# Examly
Created Examly, a comprehensive MERN stack-based web application designed for conducting exams in universities and colleges. The platform features an admin dashboard, user login, registration, and modules for examinees, examinations, question banks, and sessions. This project demonstrates my expertise in developing scalable web applications.
